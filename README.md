# 🈸 Hypothesis-testing_Six-Sigma_Manufacturing-operations_Excel (Significance of test)
This repository demonstrates how to conduct statistical hypothesis testing using Excel, including: 
- Sample size estimation
- Calculation of p-values
- Test statistics (z-test & t-test)
- One-tailed and two-tailed probabilities

## 🉑 Sample size estimation
Sample size can be calculated by answering three simple questions
-> How much variation present in the population? (σ)
-> At what interval or tolerance does the true population mean need to be estimated? (±Δ)
-> How much representation error is allowed in the sample? (α)

The sample size (n) of continuous data can be determined by the formula: 

**n = [(Z₁₋α/₂*σ)/Δ]^2**

The sample size (n) for discrete data can be determined by the formula:

**n= [(Z₁₋α/₂)/Δ]^2*p(1-p)**; σ = sqrt(p(1-p)

'p' is the % of non-defective

## 🈺 P-value
The p-value is the probability that any differences observed are due to random chance or common cause variation
- A small p-value indicates a small probability that the observed results could happen under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true
- Low p-values lead us to reject the null hypothesis
- If lower than alpha risk, the null is rejected in favor of the alternative
- High p-values indicate that we haven't gathered sufficient data or evidence to not reject the null hypothesis

## 🈷️ Test statistics
- The test statistics is calculated based on the observations
- A test statistic is used to determine the validity of a hypothesis test
- If the null hypothesis is true, the test statistic will be random variable with known distribution
- If we can conclude that the test statistic came from the population, then the null is not rejected
- The calculation of test statistic and critical value will depend on the particular hypothesis test
- If it is not likely for the test statistic to come from population, then the null is rejected

## 🆚 2-tailed and 1-tailed probability
- Use of 2-tailed probability and 1-tailed probability depends on the direction of the alternative hypothesis
- If the alternative hypothesis tests more than one direction, either less or more, use a 2-tailed probability value from the test, i.e., Mean (A) ≠ Mean (B)
- If the alternative hypothesis tests are one direction, use a 1-tailed probability value from the test, i.e., Mean (A) > Mean (B)

## ✴️ Methods of Hypothesis Test conclusions
Compare a calculated test statistic to a critical value
- If test statistic > Critical value, reject H₀
- If test statistic < Critical value, fail to reject H₀

*Compare p-value to the alpha risk*

- If p-value < alpha risk, reject H₀
- If p-value > alpha risk, fail to reject H₀

## ☢️ Statistical & Practical Significance of Hypothesis test
### ‼️Significant but not Practical:
Assume that a Steel manufacturing company is comparing two methods of fulfilling customer orders in which the new method is significantly faster than the standard ones by 1 hour, however to justify the cost of changing to the new method, a reduction of 2 hours is required

### ⁉️Practical but not Significant:
Assume that a bank call center is piloting new technology to process payments which has increased transactions by 500 per day. Although the new technology has a higher average that will have a practical impact to the business there is no statistically significant difference since p ≥ 0.05

## 🛃 Case Study: Hypothesis testing by the Quality Manager in a Steel manufacturing plant
### 🈲 Objectives

1. Sample size estimation for defect detection
2. Cycle time comparison before and after improvement for Casting & Rolling machines
3. One tailed Z-test for Thickness validation for Casting & rolling machines
4. Comparing planning performance based on shifts using T-Test

---

### ☯️ Interpretation

1. *Situation 1: The Quality Manager looks at the Planning Resource data that is continuous. Currently, the population Standard Deviation for Casting & Rolling are at 19 units and 49 units respectively. Now, the Manager wants to decide the size of a sample that can improve the defect rate within ±10 units tolerance with 90% confidence level*

From the excel calulation, it is recommended to have the sample size:

- for casting, with a range between 70 to 90 data points
- for rolling, with a range between 60 to 80 data points

   *Situation 2: Later the Quality Manager realized that one of the machine outputs is defective. The non-defective population proportion for casting machine is 70%. Now, the Manager wants to decide the sample size to draw the sample that can estimate the proportion of compliant steel sheets within ±20 units tolerance with 90% confidence level*

From the excel calculation, for casting, it is recommended to have a sample size ranging between 50-80 data points

2. *Situation: After the joint regional meeting, the company decided to upgrade casting and rolling machines in the plant that can improve the cycle time
