# ðŸˆ¸ Hypothesis-testing_Six-Sigma_Manufacturing-operations_Excel-Sample-size-p-values-and-test-statistics
This repository demonstrates how to conduct statistical hypothesis testing using Excel, including: 
- Sample size estimation
- Calculation of p-values
- Test statistics (z-test & t-test)
- One-tailed and two-tailed probabilities

# ðŸ‰‘ Sample size estimation
Sample size can be calculated by answering three simple questions
-> How much variation present in the population? (Ïƒ)
-> At what interval or tolerance does the true population mean need to be estimated? (Â±Î”)
-> How much representation error is allowed in the sample? (Î±)

The sample size of continuous data can be determined by the formula
